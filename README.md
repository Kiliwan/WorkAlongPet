# WorkAlongPet
Inspired by the Accenture project during the STARThack Hackathon of finding new ways to enable people to interact online during the pandemic.

The idea was to make a multiplayer world where people can have a pet and meet up virtually as they cannot do it IRL. Their pet would also accompany them during their work day and remember them to take care of their health, make small breaks, drink enough water, exercise, etc.

Made in collaboration with Elisa Bianchi in 2021.
